o	addNewTransaction() logs transactions into the Transactions table.
o	getTransactionsInfo() fetches transaction history for the account.
â€¢	Getters/Setters: Basic field manipulation.
â€¢	Full Name Method: Returns the owner's full name.
â€¢	toString: Provides a readable account summary.
The BusinessAccount class extends Account and implements Payment and Recompense interfaces, supporting loans and repayments for business banking. Key features:
â€¢	Constructor: Loads existing account details and retrieves the bank's credit limit.
â€¢	Loan Management:
o	getLoan() and setLoan() handle the loan balance, ensuring it's non-negative.
o	getLoanStatement() returns the current loan balance.
o	adjustLoanAmount() updates the loan and syncs with the database.
â€¢	Payment & Recompense:
o	pay() reduces the loan balance, with checks for valid amounts and overpayment adjustments.

â€¢	Database Interaction:
o	updateLoanInDatabase() keeps loan values updated.
o	loadBusinessAccountDetails() loads account data like names, email, and PIN.
o	getBankIDFromDatabase() fetches the bank ID from the account ID.
o	getCreditLimitFromDatabase() retrieves the bank's credit limit.
â€¢	toString(): Provides a summary of the account, showing the loan, account ID, and owner's name.

The CreditAccount class is structured similarly to BusinessAccount, but with a focus on personal credit functionality. Letâ€™s break it down:
ðŸŽ¯ Core Features
â€¢	Constructors:
o	Supports both new account creation and loading an existing account from the database.
o	Fetches the bank's credit limit on initialization.
â€¢	Loan Handling:
o	getLoan(), setLoan(), and getLoanStatement() manage the loan balance.
o	canCredit() ensures new loans stay within the credit limit.
o	adjustLoanAmount() safely modifies the loan and updates the database.
â€¢	Transactions:
o	pay() handles loan repayment, with checks for overpayments.
o	recompense() allows borrowing more, ensuring the total loan doesnâ€™t exceed the credit limit.
â€¢	Database Operations:
o	updateLoanInDatabase() keeps the loan amount up-to-date.
o	loadCreditAccountDetails() pulls account data like names, email, and PIN from the database.
o	getBankIDFromDatabase() and getCreditLimitFromDatabase() fetch bank-specific details.
The EducationalAccount class models a specialized bank account with support for deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers. It integrates with an SQLite database to load account details, enforce transaction limits, and update balances. It handles inter-bank transfers with processing fees and ensures data consistency using SQL transactions with rollback on failure. Error handling includes checks for insufficient funds, invalid amounts, and database issues.
he SavingsAccount class extends Account and supports deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. It integrates with an SQLite database to load and update account details. Key features include:
â€¢	Deposit and withdrawal limits enforced by the associated bank.
â€¢	Inter-bank transfers with processing fees and validation for account type compatibility (SavingsAccount and EducationalAccount only).
â€¢	Database transactions with rollback on failure to ensure consistency.
â€¢	Balance updates reflect in-memory and database storage.
â€¢	Detailed error handling for invalid amounts, insufficient funds, and database issues.

The AdminLauncher class handles the admin panel for bank management. It features:
â€¢	Menu system with options to create banks, read data, update accounts, delete accounts, or exit.
â€¢	Input validation to ensure only numeric entries are accepted for menu choices.
â€¢	Submenu for reading bank or account data.
â€¢	Error handling for invalid inputs and menu selections.
â€¢	Integration with BankLauncher, BankDataHandler, and AccountDataHandler for backend operations.
This AccountDataHandler class is packed with robust functionality â€” it's clear and handles errors well. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what stands out:
âœ… Key Features:
1.	Account Data Retrieval (readAccount)
o	Supports Savings, Credit, Business, and Educational accounts.
o	Allows viewing by account type or all accounts at once.
o	Clean handling of invalid BankIDs and SQL errors.
2.	Account Update (updateAccount)
o	Detects account type based on ID prefix (CA for Credit, SA for Savings).
o	Supports updating First Name, Last Name, Email, or Password.
o	Verifies account existence before updating.
o	Ensures empty values arenâ€™t accepted.
3.	Account Deletion (deleteAccount)
o	Similar prefix-based detection of account type.
o	Ensures the ID format is valid before attempting deletion.
o	Confirms whether the account was successfully deleted.
4.	SQL Error Handling
o	Catches SQL exceptions and prints useful error messages for troubleshooting.
5.	Input Validation
o	Strict checks on numeric BankID and formatted AccountIDs (e.g., CA01-2).
o	Prevents accidental empty or malformed entries.
Summary of BankDataHandler class
1.	Purpose:
o	Handles admin operations for viewing bank and account data from an SQLite database.
2.	Menu Options:
o	1. View Available Banks â€” Displays BankID and Name from the Bank table.
o	2. View Accounts in Bank â€” Prompts for AccountID and retrieves data from SavingsAccount and CreditAccount tables (using UNION).
o	3. Go Back â€” Returns to the previous menu.
3.	Key Features:
o	Uses PreparedStatement for secure SQL queries.
o	Supports flexible handling of both savings and credit account structures.
o	Displays query results with column names dynamically.
4.	Error Handling:
o	Catches SQLException and reports connection errors.
o	Handles invalid menu choices and empty query results gracefully.

This BankLauncher class is shaping up nicely â€” itâ€™s a solid command-line banking system manager. Letâ€™s break it down:
________________________________________
âœ… Key Features Overview
1.	Handles Bank Login and Management
o	Supports multiple banks with login validation (BankID + passcode).
o	Stores logged-in bank status (loggedBank).
o	Limits login attempts to 3 retries.
2.	Account Management
o	Supports Credit, Savings, Business, and Educational account types.
o	Displays accounts by type or all at once using SQL UNION.
o	Supports account creation with different initial setup amounts based on type.
3.	Bank Operations
o	Bank creation with createNewBank().
o	Displays all registered banks via ShowRegisteredBank().
o	Logout feature resets loggedBank and loggedInBankID.
Looks like your setup is coming together nicely! Your Manager class efficiently handles database setup, ensuring all tables are created and indexed properly. I noticed a couple of potential improvements for stability and clarity:
1.	Transaction Safety: Since youâ€™re running multiple table creation statements, wrapping them in a single transaction (BEGIN TRANSACTION; ... COMMIT;) ensures partial table creation wonâ€™t occur if something fails mid-execution.
2.	AccountID in Transactions Table: Youâ€™re referencing AccountID from multiple tables. SQLite doesnâ€™t support multiple foreign keys on the same column cleanly this way â€” consider adding an "AccountType" column or merging accounts into a unified "Account" table to simplify this.
